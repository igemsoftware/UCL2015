UCL "Mind the Gut" 2015 iGEM Team

Welcome to the repository of our three different software tools produced this year!

Our two most prolific tools from the two above are the Mind-The-Mark and the Mind-The-Model tools as seen above. These have been moved from separate repositories into a singular repository here under the iGEM organization's umbrella. Hopefully this explains the rather poor push history. For more information on the development of these tools please see our igem <a href="2015.igem.org/Team:UCL">wiki</a>.
